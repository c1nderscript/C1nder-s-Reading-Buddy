# KnowledgeBase Markdown Merger & Kindle Converter

This repository provides a simple pipeline to convert a folder of documents into a Kindle-ready eBook.

## Features

- Recursively scan your knowledgebase for PDF, Markdown, DOCX, TXT and MDX files.
- Convert the supported files into clean Markdown using `pandoc`.
- Split large Markdown files into chunks of about 20,000 characters.
- Shuffle the chunks to randomize reading order.
- Convert the shuffled files to EPUB or MOBI format.
- Track processed files to avoid duplication.
- Run the entire workflow with a single script.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) for file conversions
- `kindlegen` (optional, recommended for MOBI output)
- Unix-like shell environment (Linux, macOS, WSL)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository and navigate into it.
2. Install dependencies and verify `pandoc`:

   ```bash
   pandoc --version
 codex/set-kb_dir-from-environment-variable
   Optionally install kindlegen and ensure it is in your PATH.
   
   Set the ``KB_DIR`` environment variable or edit ``ingest_and_convert.py`` if your knowledge base lives elsewhere.
   
   🚀 Usage
   Run the full pipeline with:
   
   bash
   Copy
   chmod +x ingest_and_convert.sh split_markdown.sh shuffle_split_files.sh convert_to_kindle.sh
   ./ingest_and_convert.sh
   What happens?
   Scan & Convert
   The Python script scans your knowledgebase directory (defaults to ``~/Documents/KnowledgeBase`` or the value of ``KB_DIR``), converts PDFs, DOCX, TXT, MDX, and Markdown to Markdown files in Ingest/.
   It skips files already processed by referencing Logs/processed_files.log.
   
   Split Markdown
   Large markdown files are split into ~5,000 character chunks saved into Split/.
   
   Shuffle Chunks
   The chunk files are shuffled randomly to vary reading order.
   
   Convert to Kindle Format
   Markdown chunks in Split/ are converted to .mobi (if kindlegen is present) or .epub in Kindle/.
   
   🗂️ Tracking Processed Files
   The system keeps a log of all processed source files in Logs/processed_files.log.
   
   This prevents re-processing unchanged files on subsequent runs.
   
   To reset processing, clear or remove the log file.
   
   ⚠️ Notes
   Large PDFs or complex documents may have imperfect markdown conversion; manual cleanup may be needed.
   
   .mdx files will be treated as markdown but JSX components are not specially handled.
   
   Ensure pandoc and kindlegen are executable from your shell.
   
   🧩 Extending & Customization
   Add support for other file types by extending SUPPORTED_EXTS in ingest_and_convert.py.
   
   Modify chunk size by editing split_markdown.sh.
   
   Add error handling and detailed logging as needed.
   
   🆘 Troubleshooting
   If conversions fail, try running pandoc commands manually on problem files to debug.
   
   Verify PATH settings if pandoc or kindlegen commands are not found.
   
   Check file permissions on source and output directories.xxxxxxxxxx bashCopyEditMerged/merged_output.md
   ```

   ```
3. Optionally install `kindlegen` and ensure it is in your `PATH`.
4. Adjust the path inside `ingest_and_convert.py` if your knowledgebase is located elsewhere. The default is `/home/$USER/Documents/K_Knowledge_Base`.

## Usage

Run the full pipeline with:

```bash
chmod +x ingest_and_convert.sh split_output.sh shuffle.sh convert_to_kindle.sh
./ingest_and_convert.sh
```

### What Happens?

1. **Scan & Convert** – `ingest_and_convert.py` scans your knowledgebase (default `/home/$USER/Documents/K_Knowledge_Base`) and converts supported files to Markdown in `Ingest/`.
2. **Split Markdown** – Large Markdown files are split into chunks saved in `Split/` using `split_output.sh`.
3. **Shuffle Chunks** – The chunk files are shuffled randomly by `shuffle.sh`.
4. **Convert to Kindle Format** – Markdown chunks are converted to `.mobi` (if `kindlegen` is present) or `.epub` in `Kindle/` via `convert_to_kindle.sh`.

## Tracking Processed Files

The system keeps a log of all processed source files in `Logs/processed_files.log`. This prevents re-processing unchanged files on subsequent runs. To reset processing, clear or remove the log file.

## Troubleshooting

- If conversions fail, try running `pandoc` commands manually on problem files to debug.
- Verify `PATH` settings if `pandoc` or `kindlegen` commands are not found.
- Check file permissions on source and output directories.
